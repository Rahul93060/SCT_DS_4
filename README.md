🚦 SkillCraft Internship | Task 04: Traffic Accident Data Analysis & Visualization
I recently completed Task 04 of my internship at @SkillCraft Technology, where I explored and visualized traffic accident patterns using a sample of the US Accidents Dataset.
📊 Objective:
 To analyze accident records to uncover trends based on:
🕒 Time of day (hourly patterns)
📆 Day of the week
🌧️ Weather conditions
🚧 Severity levels
🛠️ Key Highlights:
Performed temporal and categorical breakdown using pandas and datetime
Identified peak accident hours and weekdays
Visualized top 10 weather conditions contributing to accidents
Explored severity distribution using Seaborn and Matplotlib
Saved all visuals as structured, presentation-ready plots
💡 This project helped me understand the intersection of data science and public safety, reinforcing the power of EDA in solving real-world problems.
📂 Tools Used:
 Python | Pandas | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Datetime | Data Visualization | EDA
